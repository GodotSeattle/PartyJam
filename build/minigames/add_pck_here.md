# How to export to itch

1. Follow top-level readme instructions to generate a pck for your entry
2. Copy this and any other pck minigames into this build/minigames folder
3. Do a full game export by going to Project > Export, then "Export All...",
   which should result in an `build/index.html` file amongst others
3. Zip the whole thing and upload to itch
4. Also upload your source mini game .pck as another file, so that can be
   downloaded individually to help jduges make the overall compiled version.
