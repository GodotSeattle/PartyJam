This is a starter test repo for a Mario Party-style game jam project. This is the main game selector menu, which searches for mini-game scenes in a designated folder (res://MiniGames/) and dynamically creates a button with their name. Upon click, it loads the mini-game.

The included minigame is just there as an example to show where the minigames should be located to be seen by the project to be loaded and show required title and victory scene content, ie game name, credits, basic game instructions, etc, but how it looks or organized is up to you so be creative and have fun with it!

In your victory screen, use Global.playerWins function and pass in the player number that won, so there is score tracking!

### ---How to validate your entry before submission---
Fresh clone of the template project and copy your entry into the Minigames folder within. And when you run the template from the default scene, it should be automatically recognized and playable. If it doesn't do this, remodify your entry as needed.
