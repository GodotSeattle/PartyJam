This is a starter test repo for a Mario Party-style game jam project. This is the main game selector menu, which searches for mini-game scenes in a designated folder (res://MiniGames/) and dynamically creates a button with their name. Upon click, it loads the mini-game.

Your game files should be in their respective folder in MiniGames, and keep your core mini-game TSCN file outside of it so it can be easily found.

In your victory screen, use Global.playerWins function and pass in the player number that won, so there is score tracking!
