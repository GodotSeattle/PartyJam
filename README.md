# PNWPartyGame
 
This is a starter test repo for a Mario Party style game jam project. This is the main game selector menu that looks for mini-game scenes in a designated folder (res://MiniGames/) and dynamically makes a button with their name and will load the mini-game on click.

Your game files should be in it's own folder in MiniGames and keep your core mini-game tscn file outside of it so it can be found.

In your victory screen, use Global.playerWins function and pass in the player number that won so there is score tracking!
